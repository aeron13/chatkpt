# ChatKPT

Conversational AI can useful for studying, but it might become hard when you can't find older conversations and you can't organise them in categories.\
To solve this problem I developed ChatKPT (chat-keep-it), a web app where you can load your chats with ChatGPT in JSON format and organise them into categories and subcategories.

The platform has colorful and digital look&feel, with smooth shapes representing the molteplicity of the categories you can create and glassmorphism to add a distinctive trait.\
Designed to fit every device, it supports dark and light mode. Developed with Laravel, MySQL database, AlpineJS and Tailwind for the front-end.
